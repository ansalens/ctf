# Modern Crypto Meta

Cryptography has come a long long way since the time of Caesar. Now,
just about everything we do relies on math. Math, it turns out, is very
hard to beat if it is done properly. Math can tell you that it is
provably impossible for an attacker to decrypt something earlier than
the heat death of the sun. That is pretty awesome. If you find yourself
trying to beat math, you're probably attacking the wrong part of the
problem. Learn about encryption below.
